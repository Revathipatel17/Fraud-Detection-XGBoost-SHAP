🛡️ Fraud Detection using Random Forest, CNN, and XGBoost with SHAP

This project explores and compares multiple machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The models include **Random Forest**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, and **XGBoost** with SHAP explainability.

📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Comparison of Random Forest, CNN, and XGBoost
- 📈 Evaluation using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve
- 📊 SHAP values to interpret XGBoost predictions
- 📉 Bar chart to visualize model performance

📊 Dataset

Due to GitHub’s file size limit, the dataset is not included in this repository.

➡️ Download it here:  
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

After downloading, upload `creditcard.csv` manually to your Colab or local environment.

🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Upload the `creditcard.csv` dataset
3. Run all cells to:
   - Train Random Forest, CNN, and XGBoost models
   - Evaluate their performance
   - Visualize results including SHAP and ROC curves
